I work in the GIS department of the planning department in a growing community outside of Lexington, Kentucky. Before I started working there in April, I had been aware of open data as a thing to use and an ethos. I had a dust up in the Fayette County Clerk's office when I opted to take pictures of deed book pages with my phone rather than pay $0.25 per page to copy them.


Closed data creates friction Competencies



I'm a work in progress

When I read the announcement for the open address research internship a few weeks ago, I was left with mixed-feelings. I was excited because the opportunity to work on a project that contributes to the noble challenge of opening up the data silos dotting server rooms, desks, laptop bags, key chain, thumb drives, etc. around the world seems fabulous. I was disappointed because this position is an internship. I already have a fine job doing mapping work for the public and seeking an internship would be a backwards move in the career path narrative. Nonetheless, here I am, applying for this open data internship. Why?

I work for the planning office of a small community outside Lexington, Kentucky. And while I derive great satisfaction from serving the public, each day I must tamp down my philosophical opposition to the archaic data pricing schemes and restrictive license agreement applied to our layers so that I can uphold the ordinances that . 

In my capacity as GIS Technician at the Georgetown-Scott County Planning Commission, one of my main duties is to serve data requests for those who request our local datasets. Our office works on an archaic pricing model that charges clients a per acre per layer rate. The process of serving these data requests is expensive and frustrating for the people who come to us and time consuming for our small, two-person department. We would do well by opening up our GIS data, but that is an issue for which I don't have the political clout, nor is it an urgent priority in our office.
