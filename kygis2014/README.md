# Where's the Story?

## Abstract

> In the past year, the term "story map" has increasingly become associated with Esri. While the
Story Map competition at the 2014 User Conference brought in some fascinating submissions,
the lack of narrative structure in many left some to wonder, "Where's the story?" In this
presentation, I draw on the historical development of Georgetown, Kentucky to try and
rebalance the relationship between story and map. By focusing on narrativity in the creation of
platform-neutral story maps, I challenge Esri's implicit ownership to the story map and
encourage greater attention to the value of narrative in map-based communication.
