One reason is the easy access to amenities in Lexington, Cincinnati, and Louisville via a comprehensive network of state highways and both I-75 and I-64.<br><br><img src='http://i1185.photobucket.com/albums/z344/buspainter2005/i75-construction_zps71383a82.jpg' /><br><br>Indeed, the history of Scott County and its cities - Georgetown, Stamping Ground, and Sadieville - all owe some part of their existence to the influence of transportation and mobility. This story map looks at various stages of transportation history in Scott County, moving in time from the days before European-descended settlers came to the area, through the heyday of the railroad, to the present automobile society. We'll stop once at each city to highlight how transportation has contributed and continues to contribute to life in Scott County.<br><br><i>Click in the map to advance the story.</i>";

It is said that the area called Stamping Ground was a popular stop for buffalo herd. Their hooves, great in number as they were, had the effect of compacting the grounds where they roamed, thus the name. But Stamping Ground also sits at the confluence of several buffalo roads. These wide tracks were formed by the numerous buffalo as they trekked throughout the land. While the buffalo may now be gone, their legacy lives on. Today, several of the roads in the area, including the road to Great Crossings, west of Georgetown, are supposed to have been built atop these buffalo roads.", // first story HTML

In 1988, Toyota opened its first plant in the United States on the north side of the city. With the 10 millionth car coming off the line in 2014, the Georgetown is not only shaped by the automobile, but a major player in the auto market nationwide."
